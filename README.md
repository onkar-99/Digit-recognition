# Digit-recognition
This project classifies English digits(0-9) into one of 10 classes.

The model is trained on the famous SVHN dataset consisting of images of various street house numbers.
This model is trained using CNN as well as MLP techniques for comparison. 

MLP model receives an accuracy of about 75% on training data and 73% on test data.
CNN model receives a considerably high accuracy of 84.3% on training data and 84.6% on validation data.

The final output is in the form of bar plot with probability plotted for all 10 classes and it consists of 2 subplots for MLP and CNN respectively.
